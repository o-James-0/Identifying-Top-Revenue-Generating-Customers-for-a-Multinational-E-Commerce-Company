# project overview
This data science research project presents a comprehensive sales analysis of a leading multinational e-commerce company headquartered in the United States, with operations spanning across North and South America, as well as Europe. 


The objective of the study is to analyze and identify the **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers**, offering critical business insights into customer value, regional sales dynamics, and strategic growth opportunities.


Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, including data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization, this project uncovers key patterns in customer spending behavior across diverse markets. 


By ranking customers based on total revenue contribution, the analysis empowers business stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize customer relationship management, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance profitability in a globally competitive landscape.

This project serves as a practical application of data science principles in the domain of e-commerce, showcasing the impact of data-driven decision-making on strategic business outcomes.

### Data Source

**The Company's central transaction database**


### Project Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Data was collected from the Company's Central Transaction Database

- **Data Pre-processing**: Loaded the data from a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

- **Data Inspection and Cleaning**: Checked for Missing values, Checked for Duplicates.

- - Handled missing values
  - Handled duplicate values

- **Data Modification**: generated some  core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, and would be required for the purpose of the data   analysis

- **Data Aggregation**: To Compute the major metric : Total Revenue by Customer**

- **Data Sorting/ Data Ranking**: To Determine the Most Importat Metric:  **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers**

- **Data Visualization**: To uncover the **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers** in a pictorial form.

- **Data Interpretation**:

- **Key Findings**

- **Conclusions**

- **Reconmendation**



### Data Collection

Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`


### Data Pre-processing

**Data Loading**: 
Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe



__Task:__ Follow the appropriate steps in reading a CSV file into a pandas Dataframe, 


and  Read the data stored  in the csv file named:  `bikes` From your computer.


The resulting Dataframe should be named : `bikes_df`


~~~python
# solution
# solution 
import pandas as pd

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/James/Downloads/bikes.csv")
bikes_df
~~~

### Data Inspection and Cleaning

- **1. Check for Missing values**:

~~~python
# solution 
bikes_df.isna().any()

~~~


~~~python
# counting the number of missing values
Number_of_missing_values_per_column = bikes_df.isna().sum()
Number_of_missing_values_per_column
~~~


~~~python
# counting the number of rows

len(bikes_df)
~~~


~~~python
  # visualising the total number of the missing values

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Number_of_missing_values_per_column.plot(kind = "bar")
plt.plot()
~~~


- **2.Handling Missing values**:

~~~python
  # solution 
bikes_df_filled = bikes_df.fillna("Black")

bikes_df_filled
~~~



###  Check if any  columns is still containing  missing values from the:  bikes_df_filled

~~~python
# solution 

bikes_df_filled.isna().any()
~~~


- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:

~~~python
  # solution

# counting the total number of our datapoint
len(bikes_df)
~~~



- **4. Handling Duplicates**:

~~~python
  # solution
# dropping any duplicate if any exists

bikes_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)
~~~


~~~python
# recounting our data point again

len(bikes_df)

# this shows there was no duplicate in our data point
~~~



### Data Modification


~~~python
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis

# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
~~~



### Data Aggregation


~~~python
# Computing/ Aggregating the sales data to show Total Revenue by Customer , including their City, State and Country. 

# solution 
"CustomerName", "CustomerCity", "CustomerState", "CustomerCountry"	

bikes_df.groupby(["CustomerName", "CustomerCity", "CustomerState", "CustomerCountry"])["SalesRevenue"].sum()
~~~


~~~python
# adding their index number

Total_revenue_by_customer = bikes_df.groupby(["CustomerName", "CustomerCity", "CustomerState", "CustomerCountry"])["SalesRevenue"].sum().reset_index()
Total_revenue_by_customer
~~~



### Data Sorting/ Data Ranking

~~~python
# To Determine the Most Importat Metric: Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers 

# solution 

The_Top_10_customers = Total_revenue_by_customer.sort_values("SalesRevenue", ascending = False).head(10)
The_Top_10_customers
